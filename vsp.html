        <h2>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h2>
        <p>
          Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a critical methodology in modern
          DevOps and cloud engineering that allows for the automated
          provisioning and management of infrastructure through code rather than
          manual processes. By defining infrastructure in a declarative format,
          IaC improves consistency, scalability, and version control while
          reducing human error. Popular IaC tools include Terraform,
          CloudFormation, and Ansible.
        </p>
        <p>
          At VSP Vision, I was involved in migrating AWS infrastructure from
          CloudFormation to Terraform, ensuring better automation, security, and
          maintainability. This large-scale infrastructure included 123 EC2
          instances, 12 ALBs, 15 ASGs, and 3 RDS clusters across production,
          staging, and development environments. I utilized Terraformer to
          efficiently import existing configurations and refactor them into
          modular Terraform scripts, enabling seamless version control and
          collaborative management.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most challenging aspects of this migration was maintaining
          state consistency across deployments. To achieve this, I implemented
          S3 and DynamoDB as the Terraform backend, allowing for robust state
          management and minimizing configuration drift. This change
          significantly enhanced the team's ability to work on infrastructure
          modifications without overwriting each other’s changes. The Terraform
          pipeline was integrated with CI/CD tools to automate deployments and
          ensure rapid recovery from infrastructure failures.

        <h2>Policy as Code (PaC)</h2>
        <p>
          Policy as Code (PaC) refers to the practice of defining and enforcing
          security and governance policies using code. This approach ensures
          compliance, standardization, and security across cloud infrastructure
          and applications. By integrating PaC, organizations can automate
          policy enforcement, reduce misconfigurations, and enhance
          auditability.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my tenure at VSP Vision, I led the transition from Chef to
          Ansible, restructuring over 30,000 lines of Chef databags into
          modular, reusable Ansible roles and playbooks. This transition was
          crucial in improving automation efficiency and security compliance
          while reducing the complexity of existing infrastructure scripts. The
          migration was carried out in a phased manner, ensuring minimal
          disruption to ongoing operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my key contributions was automating Windows-to-Linux server
          migration. The organization relied heavily on PowerShell-based
          bootstrap scripts, each exceeding 2000 lines, to configure Windows
          servers. By rewriting these scripts as Ansible playbooks, we achieved
          a seamless migration for 57 servers, ensuring consistent provisioning
          and security standards. Additionally, the implementation of Ansible
          Tower provided centralized policy governance, reducing manual
          interventions and minimizing configuration drift by 50%.

        <h2>MonaCo (Dynatrace Monitoring)</h2>
        <p>
          Modern cloud environments require robust monitoring and observability
          solutions to ensure system reliability and performance. Dynatrace is a
          leading monitoring tool that offers AI-driven observability, anomaly
          detection, and application performance insights. At VSP Vision, I was
          responsible for integrating Dynatrace to enhance system monitoring and
          analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I played a key role in automating the deployment of 78 Dynatrace
          OneAgents across AWS infrastructure using Terraform. This automation
          eliminated the need for manual agent installation, ensuring consistent
          monitoring across all instances. By leveraging Terraform’s declarative
          approach, I created infrastructure as code templates to define agent
          deployment configurations, making monitoring setup faster and more
          scalable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another major contribution was migrating five legacy monitoring
          dashboards to Dynatrace Query Language (DQL). The existing dashboards
          lacked real-time insights and required manual updates. By
          transitioning to DQL, I improved real-time analytics, provided
          detailed performance visualizations, and enabled better root cause
          analysis for system failures. Additionally, I configured intelligent
          alerting mechanisms and anomaly detection rules, reducing mean time to
          resolution (MTTR) by 35% and decreasing downtime incidents by 40%.
